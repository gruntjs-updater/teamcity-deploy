# grunt-teamcity-deploy

> Custom grunt plugin for teamCity and autodeploy source

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-teamcity-deploy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-teamcity-deploy');
```

## Custom "teamcity-deploy" task

### Overview
There are 3 task for auto-deploying (contains 3 tasks):

```bash
// 1) Copy zip-pack of project to ENV from TeamCity 
$ grunt deploy:development:[env]
// 2) Start web-server and unit-tests checking on TeamCity
$ grunt deploy:development:tests
// 3) Run web-server on ENV (without testing) for showing in browser
$ grunt deploy:development
```

We have 2 TeamCity projects:

1) Development/Web/Client — just for run tests
grunt tasks for it:
    Task-1. Copy to ENV from TeamCity 
        command:
            ```bash
            $ grunt deploy:development:[env]
            ```
            where [env] is: dev, stb, nxt, cli, * 
            ([env] getting from TeamCity build-params)
        targets:
            — remove old pack dir and zip file inside
            — make new pack dir
            — compress project to new zip pack
            — copy zip pack to auto-deploy server path (like so: /u03/deploy/dev/hoothoot/)

    Task-2. Start for run tests on TeamCity 
        command:
            ```bash
            $ grunt deploy:development:tests
            ```
        targets:
            — change host of nodejs-server from 'localhost' to 'hs-ws-tkachenko.local' (by uname -n)
            — start server
            — run jasmin/sencha unit-tests throw phantomjs 

2) Environment/Deployment/Client — for shows in browser
    Task-1. Run on ENV
        command:
            ```bash
            $ grunt deploy:development
            ```
        targets:
            — change host of nodejs-server from 'localhost' to 'hs-ws-tkachenko.local' (by uname -n)
            — start server

###  Grunt configuration:

```js
grunt.initConfig
    deploy:                                                          // deploy task
         development:                                                // deploy:development configeration (it is just a task, and could be more then one) 
             options:
                 compress:
                     dir: "packer"
                     archive: "packer.zip"
                     includes: '.'
                     excludes: '.git/**\\*  node_modules/**\\*'
                 copyTo:                                              // full path will be: /u03/deploy/[env]/hoothoot/
                     server: "/u03/deploy/"
                     env: "*"
